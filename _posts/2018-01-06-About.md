There already exist venues to allow for discussions between researchers online, but there is currently no site for structured live discussions. I strongly believe in the importance of not only easily-shared ideas between researchers, but also ease of access to public scientific discussions. OnNeuro allows for monthly live discussions regarding new articles and developments in the fields of psychology and neuroscience.

If you are a researcher, this is your chance to spread your current work to a wider audience and to chat with other members of the scientific community! If you are not a researcher, this is a unique chance to listen/speak with scientists paving the way for research. Note that by taking part in our live discussion you are consenting to have a recorded tape of the meeting made publicly available.
