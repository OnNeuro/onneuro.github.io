OnNeuro is set to meet once a month on Discord. At the start of the month, an email will be sent out to everyone on the [mailing list](https://goo.gl/forms/vOhmWPAmmTMuXAxj2) that contains a time and date for when to meet. The email will state whether the discussion will be on a particular research article or if it will consist of a researcher presenting their work. We encourage listeners to interject at any time during the meeting via text- or voice-chat with questions or comments.

# Useful Information To Know:
1. **Discussions will take place over [Discord](https://discord.gg/zmAAx2W)** (text or voice-chat only). 
    * It takes 30 seconds to join and doesn't require downloading or registering a new account -- just follow this [handy-dandy guide](https://onneuro.github.io/ImageAssets/DiscordInstruct.png).
2. **Discussions may consist of either**:
    1. Discussion of an article
        * If the meeting is based on a research paper, prior reading (or at least skimming) of the article is expected.
    2. Presenting original research 
3. **Discussions will be led by an individual presenter** who will provide others with a powerpoint to follow along. 
    * Meetings have no set length, and duration may vary depending on the topic and amount of discussion. It is fine to join and leave at any time (but note that joining late may lead to confusion as to what is going on). 
4. **Meetings will be recorded** for later listening. 
    * This is so people can still listen to the discussion despite not being available at the scheduled time.

**Please email onneuro@gmail.com if you would like to lead a future discussion** (either article discussion or presentation of your own research) or if you simply wish to suggest an article or topic for discussion.
